      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hi there, my name is <br /></p>

      <h3>Manel Homri</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Kareem Ali. I’m the product development manager at Smart
        Solutions. I’ve created over a dozen apps designed to streamline sales
        and marketing activities for busy professionals. I see myself as a
        relentless problem-solver, and I’m always looking for a new challenge.
        I’ve recently gotten interested in recreational boating and noticed that
        the sales professionals at Dockside Boats don’t seem to have a
        streamlined system for tracking their sales. I’d love to discuss your
        needs in this area and find out if you’re interested in participating in
        beta testing for a new sales app I’m developing.

          She had been told time and time again that the most important steps
          were the first and the last. It was something that she carried within
          her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted
          everything. He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn't
          the most important. The last step wasn't the most important. It was
          the next step that was the most important.

          The headphones were on. They had been utilized on purpose. She could
          hear her mom yelling in the background, but couldn't make out exactly
          what the yelling was about. That was exactly why she had put them on.
          She knew her mom would enter her room at any minute, and she could
          pretend that she hadn't heard any of the previous yelling.
